# Infrastructure

This is a snapshot of the TaskManager from the infrastructure week of the TaskManager blog posts.

We've set up models, some of the extensions that will handle the models and unit tests to illustrate that they work.

You'll note that we've broken the code structure into three main areas:

* Models
* Utilities
* Views

Elements of the app will be handled appropriately in the different areas.
