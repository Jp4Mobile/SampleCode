# Testing with the Different Architectures for our TaskManager App

Last time, we introduced the MVVM, MVVM (with Combine), and TCA architectures into our sample code.

Before we could properly evaluate the architectures, it feels prudent to look into how each of them is tested.

## MVVM

[Sample Code](./MVVM/TaskManager/)

##### Two flavors

I have both MVVM and MVVM with combine for the MVVM functionality.

[With Combine Sample Code](./MVVM-Combine/TaskManager/)

## TCA

[Sample Code](./TCA/TaskManager/)

This batch of sample code illustrates how testing is done with the three different architectures.

And I'll get into some of the debugging issues that I found when I was coding up the last blog post, which didn't fit into the big post last time.
